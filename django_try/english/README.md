# English Vocabulary
#### Video Demo: [youtube video url](https://youtu.be/gFbeKch_0ls)
#### Description:

The project is designed to cater to individuals who face challenges in improving their English vocabulary. The platform offers a user-friendly web application where individuals can sign up and create custom learning lists. These lists contain relevant images and are pre-populated with words that are already stored in the platform's database.

Once a user creates a learning list, they can repeat it as often as they wish to help memorize the words better. With each repetition, the user is more likely to store the new vocabulary in their memory, enabling them to recall the words more easily in the future.

As a user becomes more comfortable with the words in a specific learning list, they can add it to their "My Words" list. This feature allows them to revisit the list at longer intervals, which helps to retain the words more effectively over time.

Overall, the platform provides a convenient and efficient way for individuals to expand their English vocabulary and enhance their communication skills. The platform's well-designed interface and intuitive learning process make it an excellent tool for anyone looking to improve their English language proficiency.
