Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
in low amount of simulations, there are less team predicted to have a chance

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
After a curtain amount (here I think 10000) predictions get same when simulation number increase. In this problem, I think 10000 is good enough
